iCNTCRY, genuine emotion & expression are two most important things thhat make this brand what it is. Throughout transcribing my life into lyrics, instrumentals, & songs. I have learned how to express myself throough rythym energy and vocals. I love my fans and music is what keeps me at bay. I personally use music to keep thoughts and emotions from being bottled up. Thats why I have created this brand iCNTCRY. I want to share and motivate others of this same escaoe that I find through music. Also a brand where other sadboys and sadgirls can have something to resonate with and music to relate to. iCNTCRY is full of suprises and projects. Stay Tuned to see what we have in store for the future!!! -towel :)
